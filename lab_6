# Function to encode a message by adding 3 to each digit and taking the modulo 10
def encoder(message):
    result = ''  # Initialize an empty string to store the encoded message
    for digit in message:  # Iterate through each character in the message
        new_digit = str((int(digit) + 3) % 10)  # Convert the character to integer, add 3, and take the modulo 10
        result += new_digit  # Append the encoded digit to the result string
    return result  # Return the encoded message

# Function to decode an encoded message by subtracting 3 from each digit and taking the modulo 10

    result = ''  # Initialize an empty string to store the decoded message
    for digit in message:  # Iterate through each character in the message
